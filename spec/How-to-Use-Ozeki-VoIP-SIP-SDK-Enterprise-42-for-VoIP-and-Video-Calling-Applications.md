In this article, we will show you how to use Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK Enterprise 42 to create a simple VoIP and video calling application in C#.Net. You will need to download and install the SDK from the official website[^1^], and have Visual Studio 2019 or later installed on your computer.
 
The steps are as follows:
 
1. Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Studio.
2. Add a reference to the OzekiSDK.dll file from the SDK installation folder.
3. Drag and drop two PictureBox controls and two Button controls from the Toolbox onto the Form.
4. Name the PictureBox controls as localVideo and remoteVideo, and the Button controls as callButton and hangupButton.
5. Double-click on the Form to generate the Form\_Load event handler.
6. In the Form\_Load event handler, create an instance of the SoftPhone class from the SDK. This class represents a software phone that can register to a SIP server and make and receive calls.
7. Create an instance of the PhoneLine class from the SDK. This class represents a phone line that can be registered to a SIP server with a SIP account.
8. Create an instance of the PhoneCall class from the SDK. This class represents a phone call that can be initiated or accepted by a phone line.
9. Create an instance of the MediaConnector class from the SDK. This class allows you to connect media devices such as microphones, speakers, cameras, etc. to each other or to media handlers such as encoders, decoders, mixers, etc.
10. Create an instance of the VideoViewerWF class from the SDK. This class allows you to display video frames on a Windows Forms control.
11. Subscribe to the events of the SoftPhone, PhoneLine, PhoneCall, and VideoViewerWF classes. These events will notify you about the status changes and media events of these objects.
12. In the SoftPhone\_IncomingCall event handler, accept the incoming call by calling the Accept() method of the PhoneCall object.
13. In the PhoneLine\_RegistrationStateChanged event handler, check if the phone line is registered successfully by checking the state property of the RegistrationStateChangedArgs object. If it is registered, enable the callButton control.
14. In the PhoneCall\_CallStateChanged event handler, check if the call is in progress by checking the state property of the CallStateChangedArgs object. If it is in progress, disable the callButton control and enable the hangupButton control. Also, connect the local camera device to the local video viewer and to the phone call by using the MediaConnector object. Connect the remote video stream from the phone call to the remote video viewer by using the MediaConnector object.
15. In the VideoViewerWF\_FrameReceived event handler, display the received video frame on the PictureBox control by calling its SetImage() method.
16. In the callButton\_Click event handler, initiate an outgoing call by calling
the Start() method of
the PhoneCall object with
the SIP URI of
the destination as
the parameter.
17. In
the hangupButton\_Click event handler,
terminate
the current call by calling
the HangUp() method of
the PhoneCall object.

That's it! You have created a simple VoIP and video calling application using Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK Enterprise 42. You can test it by running it on two computers that are connected to the same SIP server and network. You can also customize it further by adding more features such as audio handling, conferencing, recording, encryption, and more. For more information, please refer to the official documentation[^1^] and examples[^1^] of the SDK.
